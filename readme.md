Various scripts, which will shortly be edited and reorganized (sorry!) now that I have a better idea what I'm doing.

A collection of Applescripts that I've found useful or think might become useful later on. Some are from other developers or contain elements from other developers (always attributed) and I have edited those portions for (my) legibility. Lots of parentheses, lots of comments.

# Syntax notes #

Variable names: Generally formatted in lowercase_with_underscore_separators

Function names: Generally formatted in camelCase

Typical Comments:

	##

Comments RE: work to do on the script:

	--

Comments on blocks:

	## Description of block
	on block. . .
or
	try # Description of try
	. . .
	
Some error notifications rely on Growl, but I am slowly moving them to the Notification Center or to alert boxes.
