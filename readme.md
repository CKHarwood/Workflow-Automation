Various scripts and other code that I find useful (or once found useful). Often these include work or advice from others (always attributed) with more extensive commenting or revision to make the results more legible (to me).

## TO DO ##
- [ ] Import the old scripts.
- [ ] Add short headers as useful (short description, name and link, license note).
- [ ] Standardize the syntax a bit (not to be pedantic, but to make scripts easier for me to read).
- [ ] Change Growl notifications to Notification Center notifications or alert boxes.
